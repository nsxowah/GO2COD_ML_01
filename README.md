# Recognizing Handwritten Digits with ConvNet Architecture

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The objective is to evaluate the performance of a CNN model in classifying 28x28 grayscale images into 10 possible digit classes (0-9). The project covers data preparation, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and error analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, labeled with the corresponding digit class (0-9). The dataset is split into training and test sets:
- Training Set: 60,000 images.
- Test Set: 10,000 images.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project follows this architecture:

- Input Layer: 28x28 grayscale image.
- Convolutional Layer: 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, activation function ReLU.
- Max-Pooling Layer: Pool size 2x2.
- Convolutional Layer: 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, activation function ReLU.
- Max-Pooling Layer: Pool size 2x2.
- Flatten Layer: Flatten the data to feed it into fully connected layers.
- Dense Layer: 128 units, activation function ReLU.
- Dropout Layer: Dropout rate of 0.5 to reduce overfitting.
- Output Layer: 10 units, activation function softmax for multi-class classification.
The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
- Confusion Matrix: To show the distribution of true versus predicted labels.
- Precision: The ability of the model to classify positive instances correctly.
- Recall: The ability of the model to identify all positive instances.
The confusion matrix is plotted to show how well the model performs across different classes. Additionally, error analysis is performed to identify misclassifications and their probabilities.

## Results
After training the CNN model, the following results are obtained:

- Test Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model on the test dataset.
- Test Loss: The loss value on the test set.
- Confusion Matrix: A heatmap showing how the model predicted each class compared to the true labels.
- Precision, Recall: The calculated metrics to assess model performance.
